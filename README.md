# Fast-Fourier-Transport
This is part of the project for my final project for the BSc Mathematics at Queen Mary, University of London. It contains my implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform, a denoising function and an example of this algorithm being tested on a song with artificially added noise. I also implemented an algorithm to solve computationally McKendrickâ€“von Foerster equation with the FFT, and spectral derivatives.
The FFT file contains the Fast Fourier Transform function used throughout the examples, the Denoiser file contains the denoising function and the main file produces the denoised noisy wav audio files as examples. Furthermore, the computationalPDE file contains the PDE solved and outputs a sketch given initial conditions.

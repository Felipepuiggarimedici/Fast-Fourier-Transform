# Fast-Fourier-Transport
This is part of the project for my final project for the BSc Mathematics at Queen Mary, University of London. It contains my implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform, a denoising function and an example of this algorithm being tested on a song with artificially added noise. I also implemented an algorithm to solve computationally McKendrickâ€“von Foerster equation with the FFT, and spectral derivatives.
